    Gravity Logic has been founded by the team behind the Whistler Mountain Bike Park’s success.
    In fact, each Gravity Logician is still actively involved in the continuing development of Whistler’s Park.
    Clearly not a bunch of out of touch consultants.

    Director Dave Kelly is the genius behind A-Line, Dirt Merchant and Whistler’s legendary “flow”.
    He has been involved with the Whistler Mountain Bike Park since 1996 and was among the first to
    officially establish downhill mountain bike trails on Whistler Mountain. As the park grew,
    Dave worked his way up from lead hand to co-manager of the bike park. In 2007, Dave started working
    with Gravity Logic offering trail development advice to resorts throughout North America and Europe.
    Dave also has 11 years experience with the Whistler Mountain Ski Patrol bringing experience
    in risk management, safety, and construction best practices to Gravity Logic’s portfolio.

    Director Tom “Pro” Prochazka managed the Whistler Mountain Bike Park from 2001 to 2007. His ability
    to visualize trails and trail features that are both progressive and safe has earned him international
    respect from casual park visitors and professional riders. Tom’s 20 years of experience as a carpenter
    and sawyer are an incredibly valuable asset when designing trail features that are structurally sound,
    safe, and fun to ride.

    Director Rob Cocquyt worked on design and construction of the first trails on Whistler Mountain in 1995.
    In 1996, he established his own trail design and construction company and, over the following years,
    secured government funding and hired crews to build some of Squamish’s most highly regarded trails.
    Rob worked full-time with the Whistler Mountain Bike Park from 2005-2008 as lead hand, carpenter, and
    finally as trail crew supervisor. Since 2007, Rob has traveled the globe with Gravity Logic helping design,
    develop and build some of the most successful bike parks in the world.
